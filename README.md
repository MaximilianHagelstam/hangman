# Hangman

This is a terminal based hangman game.
The objective of the game is to guess a random word from a list of 1000 words.
You have 8 lives.
The purpose of this project was to become more familiar with java.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to practise java fundamentals.

### What I learned:
The purpose of this project was not necessarily to learn something new, but I still learned a couple of new things:

 - Generating a random integer within a range
 - IO
 
I also practised things I already knew:
- If-else statements
- Switch statements
- Methods
- For loops
- Exception handling
- Working with strings
